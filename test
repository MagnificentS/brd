**85% of AI projects fail. Here's the hidden reason why.**



Everyone is eager to launch chatbots, RAG systems, and AI automation. But Harvard Business Review's research shows:



> **68-70% of AI failures come from bad data, not poor algorithms.**



**The harsh truth:**
- Data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning messy data and only 20% building models.
- Just 3% of companies' data meets basic quality standards (HBR, 2024).
- Low data quality costs US businesses $3.1 trillion each year.



**Here's what's really going on:**



Is that customer service bot giving wrong answers? It learned from inconsistent product databases.



Do your AI recommendations feel off? Customer data is scattered across 12 different systems with various formats.



Is your RAG system missing vital documents? The file naming conventions date back to 2019, and nobody wrote them down.



**Winning companies rely on 3 key foundations:**



- **Standardized data entry processes** (not just "fill this field")
- **Team-wide data management** (Sales and Marketing use the same lead categories)
- **Accountability for quality** (Someone is responsible for accuracy, not just data entry)



**The benefit?** Organizations with quality data enjoy **5x higher AI success rates** and can deploy solutions 60% faster.



**Bottom line:** You can retrain a model in hours. Fixing inconsistent data takes months.



The best algorithm won’t save you from garbage-in, garbage-out.
